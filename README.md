# Hosting an HTML File on GitHub Pages: A Step-by-Step Guide

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of forking a GitHub repository that contains an HTML file and hosting it using GitHub Pages—all without the need to clone it locally.

## Requirements:
- A GitHub account (Don’t have one? Sign up [here](https://github.com/join) for free).

## Steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
- Open your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click on the **Settings** tab, located at the top of the repository page.
- Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
- Under the **Branch** dropdown menu, change the setting from `None` to `main` (or your default branch).
- Hit **Save**.
- GitHub will take a few moments to deploy your site.

### 3. View Your Hosted Site
Once GitHub Pages is set up, a URL will appear at the top of the **Pages** section.  
This URL will follow the format: `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/`.

### 4. Update and Publish Your HTML File
- Navigate to the `/index.html` file in your repository.
- Edit the code as per your choice.
- After editing, click the **Commit changes** button at the top-right of the file editor.
- Enter a commit message and click **Commit changes** again to confirm.
- Your changes will appear live on your site within a few minutes.

## Conclusion
You’ve successfully forked a repository and hosted it with GitHub Pages. Now your website is live and can be easily updated through GitHub’s web interface!
